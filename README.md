# Inventory-Management-System
An inventory management system is a software application that helps businesses keep track of the items they have in stock and make decisions about how to restock and manage their inventory. It is a critical component of supply chain management, as it enables businesses to track their inventory levels and ensure they have enough products on hand to meet customer demand.

Our inventory management system is developed using Tkinter, a Python library for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs), and MySQL, a popular open-source database management system. By combining these two technologies, we have created a powerful and user-friendly system that allows businesses to easily track and manage their inventory.

The system features a range of functionality, including the ability to add and update inventory records, view reports and charts, and generate alerts when inventory levels are low. It also provides tools for tracking orders and suppliers, making it an all-in-one solution for managing the inventory of a business.

With its intuitive interface and robust feature set, our inventory management system is a valuable tool for any business looking to streamline their inventory management process and improve their overall supply chain efficiency.
